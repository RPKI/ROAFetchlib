.SH NAME
.B LIBHISTORYRPKI

The LibhistoryRPKI is an Open-source C Implementation for Live and Historical
Prefix Origin Validation of BGP Announcements.

.SH SYNOPSIS
  -lhistoryrpki

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS General
The LibhistoryRPKI is an Open-source C Implementation for Live and Historical
Prefix Origin Validation of BGP Announcements.

It enables BGP measurement analysis tools to support BGP Prefix Origin 
Validation (RFC 6811). For the live validation the RPKI-RTR protocol (RFC6810)
is used. The general validation process is impemented by the 
.B RTRLib.

.SS API

.B rpki_cfg_t* rpki_set_config(char* projects, char* collectors, char* time_intervals, int unified, int mode, char* broker_url, char* ssh_options);
 
  /* Creates a configuration and sets values for the RPKI validation */

  projects        - All RPKI projects (comma-separated list)
.RE

  collectors      - All RPKI collectors (comma-separated list)
.RE

  time_intervals  - Time intervals as UTC epoch timestamps 
                    (start_1-end_1[,<start_n>-<end_n>]*)
.RE

  unified         - Whether the validation is distinct (0) or unified (1) 
.RE

  mode            - Mode of the current validation - live(0) or historical (1)
.RE

  broker_url      - RPKI broker url
.RE

  ssh_options     - SSH user, SSH hostkey path, SSH private key path
.RE

  return          - Pointer to RPKI configuration (rpki_cfg_t*)
.RE


.B int rpki_validate(rpki_cfg_t* cfg, uint32_t timestamp, uint32_t asn, char* prefix, uint8_t mask_len, char* result, size_t size);

  /* Validates a BGP element with RPKI */

  cfg             - Pointer to the RPKI configuration 
.RE

  timestamp       - UTC epoch timestamp of the BGP elem
.RE

  asn             - Origin ASN of the BGP elem
.RE

  prefix          - BGP elem prefix
.RE

  mask_len        - Mask-len of the BGP prefix
.RE

  result          - Pointer to a buffer where the result will be stored
.RE

  size            - Size of the result buffer
.RE

  return          - 0 if the RPKI validation was valid, otherwise -1
